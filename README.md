# Manual Testing
Manual testing is a process in software development where testers manually execute test cases without the assistance of automated testing tools or scripts. It involves human intervention to identify defects, verify functionality, and ensure the overall quality of a software application.

## Manual Testing needs these to complete a project
- Test Planning
- Mind Map Using XMind
- Test Report
- Test Cases
- Bug Report
- Test Metrics

## 💥 What is it all about?
A complete manual testing project 

### ⛳ Brief about the project website
The Star Tech Online App Showcase emerges as a dynamic digital platform that seamlessly amalgamates analytics, advertising, and interactive content functionalities. With its user-centered interface, this app not only redefines the concept of app showcasing but also empowers app creators, advertisers, and users by providing a versatile range of features. 

## 💡 Test planning
At first done the test planning for better understanding about the project and overview all over the app. So that when write test cases it helps to understand the functionality.

## 💡 Mind Maps Using Xmind
It's graphical visualization for the skeleton of the site. Benefits of this is to understand the functionality with visualization that anyone can understand about the site.

## 💡 Test Report
Overall the summary of the project

## 💡 Test Cases
Main part of the project. After doing all the things that helps to write and execute the test cases more specific. In this project all the test cases have been executed without having any delay.
There are 73 Pass test cases and 9 Fail test cases. It only for the Registration and Login feature. There i maintain a sequence of testing:
- Browser Compatibility
- UI testing
- Functional testing
- Usability testing

## 💡 Bug Report
Here all the fail test cases which are have to inform to the developer.

## 💡 Test Metrics
It will depends on the following steps:
- Percentage of Test Cases Executed
- Percentage of Test Cases Not Executed
- Percentage of Test Cases Passed
- Percentage of Test Cases Failed
- Percentage of Test Cases Blocked
- Defect Density
- Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE)
- Defect Leakage
- Defect Rejection Ratio
- Defect Age
- Customer Satisfaction
